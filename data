   What better way to get into the game industry than by working as an EA intern or co-op? EA offers paid internships or co-op positions (pay ranges vary depending on location, experience and skills), so you can actually get paid for working on game. We will also include your name in the game credits - how cool is that? Better yet, an EA internship or co-op just might lead to a career with EA after your graduation. An EA internship/co-op is a great way to get real-world experience in the games industry. You get hands-on experience working on actual projects, and the team you're working with benefits from your fresh perspective. We are confident that once you've sampled life at EA you'll want to come back after graduation.
